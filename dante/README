The Dante program is on 2 parts : the maze generator and the maze solver
(the solver isnt working well / at all)

You can compil both parts at the root of the dante's folder
to use the generator : ./generator/generator x y *perfect*
x and y are the size of the maze and you can add "perfect" as an argument to create a perfect maze,
else it'll be an imperfect maze.

to use the solver : ./solver/solver map.txt
